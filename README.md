## ‚öôÔ∏è How RTK Query is Implemented

- **API Slice Setup**:
  A `bookApi.ts` created using `createApi()` from `@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react` for defining endpoints:

- **Hooks Usage**:
  RTK Query auto-generates React hooks like `useGetBooksQuery`, `useAddBookMutation`, `useBorrowBookMutation`, etc.

- **Auto Caching & Invalidation**:
  Endpoints are configured with `providesTags` and `invalidatesTags` to keep the cache synced. Used `refetchOnMountOrArgChange` on books query to get latest book data after borrowing.

---

## üìä Borrow Summary Aggregation

- API returns aggregated data.
- Frontend uses `useGetBorrowSummaryQuery()` to fetch

---

- **Minimalist and clean layout** using **ShadCN** and **Tailwind CSS**
- **Navigation bar** with routes to Home, Books, Add Book, Borrow Summary
- **Responsive** for mobile, tablet, desktop
